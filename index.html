    <h1>OVERVIEW:</h1>
    <p>
      In highly competitive industries, the usability and efficiency of certain
      features on a company website can make vast differences on user
      engagement, experience, and company profitability. These seemingly small
      variations across interface features can build into substantial swings
      that ultimately push companies with better online user experiences towards
      having larger market shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, even when developing common features of a website, it is
      important to analyze the pros and cons of existing websites that have
      these features via a Competitive Analysis, synthesizing the best aspects
      across them to build out something that maximizes accessibility and
      usability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we specifically look at websites that have aggregators,
      such as shopping carts, equipped with a favoriting function.
    </p>
    <h1>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:</h1>
    <p>
      To inform which features our aggregator should include in its design, we
      first conduct a Competitive Analysis using three different websites/apps
      across six different factors.
    </p>
    <h2>Websites Used:</h2>
    <p>
      The first website used was the CBS Sports App, which is an app that keeps
      track of daily scores and news articles from all different sports and
      allows users to favorite or aggregate their favorite teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      CBS Sports App URL:
      <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mobile"
        >https://www.cbssports.com/mobile</a
      >
    </p>
    <img src="assets/cbs.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      The second website used was the Gmail website, which is Google's email
      website and allows users to star or aggregate important emails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gmail URL:
      <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/"
        >https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/</a
      >
    </p>
    <img src="assets/gmail.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      The last website used was the Spotify app, which is an app that enables
      users to stream all different kinds of music and allows users to like or
      aggregate their favorite songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spotify URL:
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">https://open.spotify.com/</a>
    </p>
    <img src="assets/spotify.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Factors Analyzed:</h2>
    <p>The following factors were used in the Competitive Analysis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ease of favoriting new items</li>
      <li>Clarity of favoriting symbols</li>
      <li>Ease of accessing/isolating favorited items</li>
      <li>Ease of distinguishing between favorited and non-favorited items</li>
      <li>Ease of removing favorited items</li>
      <li>
        Ease of sorting/categorizing favorited items by specific attributes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Competitive Comparison Chart:</h2>
    <p>The resulting Competitive Comparison Chart is shown:</p>
    <img src="assets/chart.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Summary of Competitive Analysis:</h2>
    <p>
      For the CBS Sports App, it was most successful at clearly delineating
      between favorited and non-favorited teams on the homepage, with all
      favorited teams' scores and news appearing at the very top of the screen
      and all other scores appearing below that. In this way, users have a very
      easy time finding the relevant information for their favorite teams any
      time they open the app. However, the CBS Sports App was least successful
      at making the favoriting/unfavoriting process clear and intuitive for
      users. Specifically, in order to favorite a new team, users either have to
      navigate to a right, bottom tab labeled as “More” or click on a current
      score, then click on the specific team, and finally star it in the top
      right corner. This long user flow results in poor memorability for users
      who might only add a new favorite team every few months. There is also no
      way to “sort” the favorited teams in any particular order, which makes the
      UI cluttered if users favorite a lot of teams that are all in-season at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Gmail, it was successful across the majority of the factors analyzed
      above, with the starring of emails being: easy to visually distinguish
      against other non-starred emails, simple and efficient to favorite or
      unfavorite (a single click), and straightforward to sort or categorize
      within the starred emails tab. Gmail's least successful factor included
      the use of a less intuitive star icon compared to the favoriting symbols
      employed by the other competitors in the analysis. It's also not as
      immediately obvious where the starred tab is on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Spotify, the main category it succeeded at was in its use of a clear
      purple heart symbol for denoting how to favorite songs, which provides
      good color contrast relative to the darker background of the app and
      serves as a metaphor for when people like something in real life. This
      good color contrast also helps users immediately see the album for all
      Liked Songs on the homepage. However, overall, Spotify really struggled in
      the Competitive Comparison Analysis, with it being difficult to both
      distinguish between liked and regular songs within albums and to find the
      button to like/unlike a song. Spotify as an app is more centered around
      creating new albums that share a coherent theme, rather than having a
      strict like/unlike separation across songs, but it still struggles in some
      of the basic factors looked at above.
    </p>
    <h2>Features to Implement:</h2>
    <p>
      I would definitely like to implement a clear visual distinction between
      favorited and non-favorited items. Specifically, the hierarchical
      distinction that the CBS Sports App uses I found was very effective and
      useful from a user perspective. I also liked how easy it was to
      star/favorite items in Gmail as it was the only interface that required a
      single click to favorite or unfavorite, and I will definitely make the
      favoriting feature similarly accessible in my design. Finally, Gmail also
      was the only interface that allowed users to sort the favorited items in a
      variety of ways, providing greater flexibility to users without cluttering
      the interface. In my design, I plan on providing a handful of common ways
      users can filter/sort the favorited items.
    </p>
    <h1>IMPLEMENTATION:</h1>
    <p>
      Leveraging the takeaways from the Competitive Analysis above, I decided to
      create an aggregator themed around restaurants located around Brown
      University's campus. Specifically, the website allows users to filter the
      listed restaurants based on the available food options (i.e. vegan,
      vegetarian, or seafood options) and distance to campus, sort them in
      increasing order of average entree price, and favorite/unfavorite them so
      that they appear at the top/bottom. These tools are aimed at helping
      students more efficiently narrow down their next spot to eat, so that they
      can satisfy their various dietary and accessibility needs/desires.
      Finally, there is also a reset button on the website that allows users to
      clear out any set filters/sorting and view the full range of restaurants
      on the website.

    <h1>TAKEAWAYS:</h1>
    <p>
      By first conducting a competitive analysis looking at how existing
      websites have designed their aggregators, I was able to evaluate the
      subtle, and often overlooked, differences between them before deciding on
      aspects of each I wanted to incorporate into my own implementation. I was
      surprised to find that taking this initial step to plan out what features
      I wanted to include in my design significantly expedited the development
      process and made the final product much better. Even though the
      pre-development stages of this project didn't necessarily involve drawing
      up lo-fi wireframes or hi-fi prototypes, having some form of visualization
      pertaining to different aspects of the aggregator was incredibly helpful.
      Ultimately, in particularly saturated industries with heavy online
      dependence, conducting a Competitive Analysis can serve as a crucial
      differentiating factor for companies when developing their various
      features.
